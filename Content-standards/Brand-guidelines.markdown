# {{ page.title }}

Our brand and all sub-brands are governed and managed by our Communications and Marketing department.  

All brand-related projects, existing or new, must be approved and consulted on by the Design Studio at the start of any project. This includes the councilâ€™s various service brands and partnership brands. 

Council employees should email the [Design Studio](mailto:mailto:design.studio@essex.gov.uk) for brand guidance. If you have a project in mind, submit a [project brief](https://intranet.essex.gov.uk/Documents/Project_Brief_2018.docx) along with your email.
